/// You **can** nest ``Routing`` types for more complex navigation patterns.

/// - Usage:
/// ```
/// struct SomeRouter: RoutingReducerProtocol {
///     enum Route: Routing {
///         case first(First.State)
///         // nesting another ``RoutingReducerProtocol`` is possible.
///         case modalRouter(ModalRouter.State)
///
///         enum RouteAction {
///             case first(First.Action)
///             // nesting another ``RoutingReducerProtocol`` is possible.
///             case modalRouter(ModalRouter.Action)
///         }
///
///         // Using state IDs rather than an ID based on ``self`` allows for the
///         // same screen to be routed to more than once with different state.
///         var id: UUID {
///             switch self {
///                 case .first(let state): return state.id
